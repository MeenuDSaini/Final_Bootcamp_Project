# Title: Life Expectancy Analysis: Illuminating Global Health Trends
---
**Aim**: To analyze factors influencing life expectancy, providing insights into public health and societal trends.
**Objective**: 
1. Examine global life expectancy trends.
2. Identify key factors influencing life expectancy.
3. Conduct correlation analysis to identify relationships with key determinants (e.g., GDP, education, immunization etc.) using statistical tool - **Hypothesis testing**, and **SQL**.
4. Visualize trends and disparities across countries through an interactive **PowerBI dashboard**.
5. Utilize advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to build models predicting life expectancy with Country and showcase the predictions on a **Streamlit App**.

**Target Audience**:
1. **Policymakers**: Contribute valuable insights to improving healthcare infrastructure, education systems and socio-economic conditions.
2. **Data professionals**: Analyze health and societal issues.
3. **Wider community members**: Understand and address global health challenges.
4. **Pharmaceutical companies**: Gain insights into healthcare trends and opportunities.

**Dataset overview**:
1. Dataset: Life Expectancy dataset 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mryasirturi/life-expentancy-dataset' 
2. 193 countries  included 
3. Time period:  2000-2015
4. Features in three categories:
      1. Socio Economic factors like GDP, BMI, Schooling, Alcohol, Population,Total Expenditure and 
          Percentage Expenditure, thinness  1-19 years,  thinness 5-9 years, Income composition of Resources etc.
      2. Immunization Coverage: Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria
      3. Disease Prevalence: HIV/ AIDS and Measles

## Conclusion:
Developed nations have higher life expectancies because they invest more in their economies, health services, and education. These countries also do a better job of vaccinating people, which leads to fewer diseases like measles and HIV/AIDS. This results in lower rates of infant, child, and adult deaths.

The findings suggest that developing countries need to improve their vaccination programs and healthcare strategies to boost life expectancy. Additionally, the high number of malnourished children in these countries calls for urgent action to provide better nutrition.

To make a positive change, it's essential for governments, health agencies, and international groups to work together. Pharmaceutical companies can also contribute by developing affordable vaccines and medicines for diseases affecting these regions. This not only improves people's health but also creates business opportunities that benefit both companies and communities.

In short, by focusing on better healthcare, more vaccinations, and addressing malnutrition, we can work towards closing the health gap between richer and poorer nations, creating a fairer and healthier world for everyone.
